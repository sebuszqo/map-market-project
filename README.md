## About The Project

![GifFile](https://github.com/sebuszqo/map_market_project/blob/main/mapmarket-gif.gif)

Map-Market is a project that features a map with pins representing advertisements.
- Each pin contains information such as the title, description, price, and a link to an auction portal where the item can be purchased.
- Users can browse the map and click on pins to view the details of each advertisement. Additionally, there is a search function that allows users to search for advertisements by title.
- The project also includes a form for users to add new advertisements to the map.
- This project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing way to search for and view advertisements in a specific location.
